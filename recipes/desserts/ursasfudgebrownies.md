#### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 180 C or 350 f, if you have parchment paper line your oven pan with it, it not grease with some butter and flour it.

2. In the large bowl put all your dry ingredients, sugar, cocoa powder, flour, etc. and mix them. Then add the eggs ( to not accidentally put any egg shells in the batter break them in a separate bowl before adding them) mix to combine again.

3. Put a small amount of water into your saucepan, over the sink fit your small bowl into the pan with water so it doesn't overflow if you press it to the bottom of the pan. no water should enter the small bowl if you press it down. put the water on a low to medium heat on your stove until it simmers (small bubbles) then turn down the heat a bit.

4. Put the small bowl into the water, and add all your butter and chocolate in the bowl **it is important the ingredients don't get touched by the water** stir it carefully until everything is melted. ** carefully ** !! lift the small bowl out of the pan, use a dish rag or oven mitt to protect your hands from the heat.

5. add your melted butter and chocolate goodness to your batter and mix them until smooth.

6. Pour your batter into your oven pan and place in the middle of your oven. After 30-40 minutes check with a wooden poker of done (you want some of the brownie to stick to the wood for fudgeyness, if you want a more dense "well done" brownie you want nothing to stick.)

7. When the brownie had reached a desired level of fudge take it out of the oven and let cool for at least an hour before cutting
