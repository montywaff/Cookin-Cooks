#### Ingredients

* pasta, linguine for maximum fancy
* 1 onion
* 2 cloves of garlic
* spinach (baby spinach also works)
* baby portobello mushrooms
* crumbled blue cheese
* sour cream
* olive oil, salt and pepper


#### Tools

* stove
* pan for pasta
* frying pan
* cutting board
* knife
* *optional: egg slicer*

---

#### Directions

1. Boil water for pasta, then boil pasta.

2. chop up your onion, fry it in some olive oil in the frying pan until glassy. wash and slice the baby portobellos. *(pro-tip: if you don't like cutting, an egg slicer is also egg-cellent for slicing small mushrooms.)* add them to the onion and fry.

3. Chop and wash the spinach, while the spinach drains from washing mince some garlic and add to the frying pan stir and fry for a minute and then add the spinach. cook to reduce the spinach, add salt and pepper (I also like to have some whole peppercorns in there)

4. Drain the pasta, and while it drains add the sour cream to the frying pan. Mix until it becomes a sauce. Then add the crumbled blue cheese to taste *(better to little than to much, you can always add more blue cheese when it's on the plate)* stir well.

5. Serve the paste with the sauce, add some blue cheese or pepper if needed. Be sure to impress everyone at the table with your refined adult taste for funny french cheeses!
